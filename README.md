  - **React DnD (@hello-pangea/dnd):** The core drag-and-drop logic is implemented with this library.
  - **Firebase Integration:** Authentication and real-time data are handled through Firebase.
  - **Firestore:** Board data, including tasks and columns, is persisted in Firestore.
  - **Board State:** The state of the board is managed within `BoardContext.jsx`.
  - **Environment Variables:** All sensitive configuration is managed through environment variables.
  - **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated deployment to Firebase Hosting via GitHub Actions.

## 🤝 Contributing
### Commit and Branching Practices

To contribute to this project, you must first create a new branch for your changes. This practice keeps our `main` branch clean and ensures that your contributions are reviewed before being merged.

#### How to Create a New Branch

1.  Start by ensuring you are on the `main` branch and that it's up to date.

    ```sh
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```

2.  Create a new branch with a descriptive name. Your branch name should start with a prefix indicating the type of change, followed by a short, kebab-cased description.

      - **`feature/your-feature-name`**: For adding a new feature.
      - **`bugfix/your-fix-name`**: For fixing a bug.
      - **`enhancement/your-improvement-name`**: For improving an existing feature.
      - **`docs/your-doc-change`**: For changes to documentation.
      - **`refactor/your-refactor-name`**: For code refactoring.
      - **`chore/your-chore-name`**: For maintenance tasks or build changes.

    Example:

    ```sh
    git checkout -b feature/add-dark-mode
    ```

3.  Make your changes in this new branch.

#### Committing Your Changes

Once you've made your changes, you can commit them to your new branch.

1.  Stage your changes:

    ```sh
    git add .
    ```

2.  Commit your changes with a clear and concise message. The first line should be a brief summary (under 50 characters), followed by a more detailed description if needed.

    Example:

    ```sh
    git commit -m "feat: add dark mode toggle"
    ```

3.  Push your branch to the remote repository:

    ```sh
    git push origin feature/add-dark-mode
    ```

4.  Finally, open a Pull Request from your branch to the `main` branch to have your changes reviewed and merged.
